# LeanSlate

LeanSlate is a personal project based on the popular HTML5 Boilerplate (H5BP) located at (https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).

LeanSlate offers a clean slate to a new project while remaining minimal in file size and structure. This allows quick prototyping and new developers a chance to  grasp how a starting point of a project should work, while allowing them to easily expand.

## Work in Progress

While anyone is welcome to use LeanSlate, this will also be a learning tool for myself so please be patient with slow development time and errors.
